#### ABSTRACT
document.add_paragraph('ABSTRACT').style = document.styles['Heading CR1']
abstract = document.add_paragraph("Hydrodynamic processes on coral reefs are important for nutrient cycling, larval dispersal, temperature variability, and understanding the impacts of terrestrial sediment, nutrients, and contaminants from adjacent disturbed watersheds on coral reef ecosystems. In order to understand the spatial and temporal variability in flow velocities and the resulting residence time of water in the fringing coral reef flat-lined embayment of Faga'alu, on the island of Tutuila in American Samoa, data from acoustic current profilers and surface cruciform drifter deployments were combined with meteorologic data and numerical wave model results. These data and model results, collected over nine days, made it possible to evaluate the relative contribution of tidal, wind, and wave forcing on the flow patterns and resulting residence times of water masses over the reef. Mean residence times varied from 2.78-0.08 hr, 2.78-0.08 hr, and 0.55-0.04 h under tidal, wind, and wave forcing, respectively; the lowest residence times were on the outer reef flat closest to where waves were breaking on the reef crest and were longest over the inner reef flat close to shore and deep in the embayment near the streammouth. These results demonstrate the applicability of a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian measurement scheme to understand spatially distribued and temporally extensive flow patterns and thus residence time in geomorphically-complex embayments that characterize many reef-lined coasts.")

#### INTRODUCTION
document.add_paragraph('INTRODUCTION').style = document.styles['Heading CR1']
document.add_paragraph("Circulation and residence time of reef waters are significant controls on the chemistry and biology of coral reefs (Lowe and Falter, 2015). Hydrodynamic conditions, including the residence time of waters over the reef flat, are a primary control on sediment dynamics in fringing reef embayments (Draut et al., 2009; Storlazzi et al., 2009) and are important for other biologically important processes like nutrient cycling, larval dispersal, and temperature regimes (Falter et al., 2004; Wyatt et al., 2012). By influencing orbital velocities, bed shear stress, and suspended sediment transport, current circulation is a strong control on the spatial distribution of deposition, resuspension, and dispersal of terrigenous sediment discharged to reefs (Hoitink and Hoekstra, 2003; Storlazzi et al., 2004; Presto et al., 2006; Hoeke et al., 2013). Spatially distributed flow patterns under variable forcing conditions are logistically difficult to quantify, so conservation planning and remediation studies are currently done with coarse estimations of pollutant discharge and distance-based plume models (Klein et al., 2012). An improved understanding of the spatial and temporal variability in flow speeds, flow directions, and residence times of water over corals is needed for understanding sedimentation patterns and impacts to coral health.")

document.add_paragraph("Studies in various coral reef environments adjacent high islands showed current speeds, directions, and residence times over reef flats are controlled by wave, wind, and tidal forcing, depending on the orientation and shape of the reef, relative to the prevailing wave, wind, and tidal climates (Storlazzi et al., 2004; Presto et al., 2006; Hench et al., 2008; Storlazzi and Field, 2008; Hoeke et al., 2011). Variations in reef morphology relative to the orientation of the dominant meteorological and oceanographic forcing can generate heterogeneous waves and currents over relatively small (hundreds of meters) spatial scales, unlike those observed along relatively linear sandy shorelines (Storlazzi et al., 2009; Hoeke et al., 2011, 2013). Current speeds and patterns over reefs exposed to remotely-generated swell are generally dominated by wave forcing (Hench et al., 2008; Hoeke et al., 2011; Vetter et al., 2010), whereas wind forcing dominates reefs protected from swell (Yamano et al. 1998; Presto et al., 2006). Tidal elevation modulates both wave-driven currents by controlling the reef crest depth and subsequent wave energy propagation into the reef flat, and wind-driven currents by regulating water depth for wind-driven surface wave development (Presto et al., 2006). Reef flat currents in wave-driven environments exhibit a pattern of rapid, cross-shore flow near the reef crest that slows moving shoreward and turns along-shore towards a deep channel where water returns seaward (Hench et al., 2008; Lowe et al., 2009; Wyatt et al., 2010). In wind-driven systems, current directions are more predominantly in the direction of the wind with possible cross-shore exchange from the reef flat to the forereef (Storlazzi et al., 2004).")

document.add_paragraph("Water flow can be quantified in two ways: 1) the Lagrangian perspective observes an individual fluid parcel as it moves through space and time, 2) the Eulerian perspective observes flow past one or more fixed locations over time. Eulerian methods are well-suited to characterizing flows over long periods and a large range of forcing conditions by using bottom-mounted instruments to record wave height and period, current speed and direction, and/or tidal elevation (Presto et al., 2006; Storlazzi et al., 2009). Collecting high spatial resolution data on hydrodynamic processes using strictly Eulerian methods is expensive and logistically difficult (Storlazzi et al., 2006; Storlazzi et al., 2004), so other methods incuding hydrodynamic models, remote sensing, and Lagrangian methods have been used. Hydrodynamic computer models can predict spatially distributed flow (Hoeke et al., 2011), but these models typically require accurate bathymetry, detailed forcing data, and significant modeling expertise (Hoeke, 2010; King et al., 2012; Wolanski et al., 2009). Lagrangian methods including the use of GPS-tracking drifters have been used to map flow patterns in coastal areas, compare to Eulerian flow descriptions (Storlazzi et al., 2006; Storlazzi et al., 2004; Wyatt et al., 2012), or validate hydrodynamic computer models (Ouillon et al., 2010). Research on rip currents in beach surf zones have shown the ability to capture synoptic measurements of small-scale flow structures and patterns by deploying large numbers of GPS-logging drifters to collect high-density observations of flow velocities (Johnson et al., 2003; MacMahan et al., 2010). Although deploying a fleet of GPS-logging drifters has yielded synoptic measurements of water movement in surf zones near linear, sandy beaches, it has not been attempted in a shallow reef environment.")

document.add_paragraph("Whereas Lagrangian measurements provide spatially explicit data on the flow field, drifter studies in nearshore environments are typically limited in number of drifters, number of deployments, and the range of oceanic and meteorological conditions experienced during deployments, making it uncertain whether they describe the dominant patterns, or short-lived anomalies (Storlazzi et al., 2006; Wyatt et al., 2010). Storlazzi et al. (2006) and Andutta et al. (2012) successfully combined Eulerian and Lagrangian methods to investigate transport patterns between adjacent reefs and islands by comparing Lagrangian drifter tracks with progressive vectors of cumulative flow calculated from Eulerian current meters to determine if short-term observations from drifters were representative of the dominant patterns.")

# USCRTF mitigation work 
document.add_paragraph("In August 2012, Faga'alu Bay on the island of Tutuila in American Samoa, was chosen by the US Coral Reef Task Force (USCRTF) as a priority watershed site for the Watershed Partnership Initiative (WPI). The WPI is an active effort of the USCRTF to reduce land-based sources of pollution by facilitating and enhancing coordination, partnerships, and contributions of US Federal agency resources and expertise to implement geographically specific integrated activities to reduce pollutant loads to coral reef ecosystems. Sediment mitigation efforts are underway to reduce sediment loading to Faga'alu Bay from the anthropogenically-disturbed areas, and other studies monitoring sediment loading from Faga'alu Stream and sediment accumulation on the reef are underway (Holst-Rice et al., 2015).")

document.add_paragraph("Because the exposure of corals to terrestrial sediment effects are a function of the magnitude of sediment loading and the duration of time the corals are exposed to sediment, our goal was to apply both Eulerian and Lagrangian methods to understand the controls on, and spatial patterns of, flow in a bathymetrically complex coral reef-lined embayment. This approach provided insight into the controls on, and elucidated the spatial patterns of, flow within the context of variations in forcing and made it possible to calculate spatially distributed water residence times (duration of exposuure) under different 'end-member' forcing conditions")

The reef is characterized by a shallow reef flat extending from just off the shore to the reef crest, where it then descends nearly vertically to the deep (>20 m) waters of Pago Pago Bay.

Faga'alu Bay is characterized by a semi-diurnal, microtidal regime where parts of the shallow reef crest and reef flat are exposed at extreme low tides (<0 m MSL; Vetter, unpublished).

Whereas the drifter tracks changed direction from onshore to cross-shore towards the ava channel, the progressive vectors over the southern reef showed little variation in flow direction, going ashore in some cases, indicating the flow velocity was relatively consistent at AS1 and AS2 and demonstrating the non-spatially uniform nature of the flow on the reef flat. The progressive vectors over the northern reef were much more erratic, and traveled much shorter distances than the drifter tracks due to the lower flow speeds observed at AS3. In general, the lengths of progressive vectors were similar to the actual tracks of the drifters, indicating similar flow speeds, albeit sometime different directions, over portions of the reef flat. The exception was over the northern reef, where drifters quickly moved into the ava channel and were influenced by very different currents than what was observed at AS3. Because drifters could only be deployed at mid-high tides when the reef flat was deep enough to avoid getting stuck on corals, the ADCPs recorded flow over the complete tidal range.

Also, a drifter deployed at the northeast reef was lost during the WIND period, so no drifter tracks were available from that location. Progressive vectors compared well with drifter tracks in speed and direction for all locations, though the progressive vector at AS3 is still short in comparison to the drifter tracks near the same location. The drifter tracks show a general trend of flow towards the northwest corner of the bay, and suggest flow out of the ava channel (at least at the surface) may be suppressed under strong onshore (easterly) winds.")

Despite waves breaking on the northern reef crest, it appears the flow across the southern reef and into the ava channel influences an overall eastward flow over the northern reef and out to sea. The drifter tracks clearly indicate a coherent pattern of clockwise flow over the southern reef, through back-reef pools and near the stream mouth, and then seaward over the northern reef and out the ava channel. All drifters exited the channel during the 1 h period, suggesting under high waves the flushing time of the whole bay is under 1 h.")

The increased flow near AS2 increased flow speeds near the ava channel and the southern back-reef pools. While the variance ellipses at AS3 was still circular, indicating variable flow directions, the magnitude of the major and minor flow axes were larger than tide and wind forcings, indicating flow speeds were higher during wave forcing. The drifters showed a clear pattern of faster, more unidirectional flows near the reef crest on the southern reef, transitioning to slower, more variable flow over the back-reef pools, and finally turning eastward over the northern reef and seaward out of the ava channel.

No data was recorded by the ADCP at AS3 simultaneously with drifters during tide forcing, due to the low water level during drifter deployments. Mean velocities from the ADCPs were lower than mean velocities from drifters in all cases except for on the southern reef under wind forcing. The RMSE and percent error (RMSE/mean) were computed for all locations during each forcing condition, and for each location under all forcing conditions. The highest percent error for a single location was at AS3 on the northern reef, likely due to the strong heterogeneity in the flow as the drifters moved into the ava channel. The lowest percent error was at AS1 on the southern reef, where the flow is most homogeneous. The percent error for all locations together was lowest for speed during tide forcing, and lowest for residence time during wind forcing.")

## From Olivia: The reason there are no values for AS3 during the "tide" period is because those drifters were only out during very low tide and the ADCP data processing filters out questionable data, which includes times when water levels get low (cutoff ends up being ~0.5 m). This may also explain the general discrepancies between the mean values from the ADCP vs the drifters ... the ADCP data (particularly at AS3) is biased to times when WL's are > 0.5 m.

## General observations

# STATEMENT ABOUT HOW THIS STUDY PRESENTS AN UNPRESCEDENTED DATA SET.
document.add_paragraph("Like the atmospheric climate, global ocean circulation controls large-scale biophysical patterns such as nutrient and heat distributions. However, whereas atmospheric climate and global ocean circulation have benefitted from remote-sensing methods, water circulation over small-scale reef ecosystems are more similar to atmospheric micro-climates, and the long-term, synoptic observations of remote sensing have not been possible. The high number of drifter deployments provided an unprecedented data set for a reef flat area, with high data density, extensive spatial coverage, and wide range of sampled forcing conditions. The bay-wide mean current speeds (residence times) varied from 1-37 cm/s (2.78-0.08 hr), 1-36 cm/s (2.78-0.08 hr), and 5-64 cm/s (0.56-0.04 hr) under tidal, wind, and wave forcing, respectively. The highest flow speeds were consistently observed at AS1 and over the southern reef near the reef crest, suggesting the strong influence of breaking waves, even when the waves were relatively small. Over the northern reef, mean flow directions were more variable, reversing and flowing towards the river mouth under strong onshore winds and sometimes during tidal forcing with variable winds. The lowest flow speeds and highest residence times were consistently observed in the northwest corner of the bay, when wave-driven flow was low or when winds were onshore.")


## Comparing differences in Lagrangian/Eulerian
document.add_paragraph("Both the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods characterized the main difference between the faster, less variable flow over the southern reef and the slower, more variable flow over the northern reef under all forcing conditions. However, where the Eulerian method characterized flows adequately over the southern reef flat where bathymetry and wave forcing were fairly simple, the spatially distributed Lagrangian method more accurately characterized spatially complex flows resulting from complex bathymetry.")

document.add_paragraph("Mean flow directions at the ADCPs were exclusively onshore, but the higher resolution drifter measurements resolved the pattern of clockwise flow over the southern reef and out to sea over the northern reef and through the ava channel. The variance ellipses and mean velocities from ADCPs showed exclusively onshore flow under all forcing conditions, whereas the higher resolution drifter data only showed the same pattern under wind forcing. This suggests that strong onshore winds, in the absence of high waves, drives all surface flows into the northwest corner of the bay, with a notable lack of seaward flow out of the ava channel. However, data density was lowest during wind forcing and perhaps drifter deployments longer than 1 h would have observed seaward flow.")

document.add_paragraph("The spatially distributed drifter measurements also illustrated several unique features in the flow pattern, particularly near areas of complex bathymetry like the ava channel. From the orientation of the reef flat and channel, it would seem that flow over the southern reef near the ava channel would flow directly from the reef crest northward into the main channel. Hoowever the flow near AS2 is deflected away from the ava channel, shoreward to the west where it flows into the back-reef pools and then enters the ava channel. This deflection is likely caused by wave energy refracting and surging into the ava channel, pushing southward from the main channel onto the southern reef.")

document.add_paragraph("Observations on the linear reef flat in Molokai, Hawaii (Presto et al., 2006), showed near-bed current speeds were faster where the reef is deeper and narrower but the variance ellipses and progressive vectors presented here (Figures "+Progressive_Vectors_ADCP_vs_Drifters['fig_num']+"-"+PCA_gridded['fig_num']+") suggest the opposite for surface drifters in this reef-lined embayment: current speeds were rapid over the shallow reef crest, slowing significantly and becoming more variable when reaching deeper back-reef pools and the ava channel. However, flow through the ava channel was not spatially constant. Under both wave and tide forcing, the flow speed through the ava channel steadily increased moving seaward, reaching a maximum at the reef crest. The same pattern was not evident under wind forcing, possibly due to wind driven flow being forced into the bay at the surface, but the data density is too low to be certain. Hench (2008) vertically binned ADCP data in a similarly configured reef in Moorea, and showed that under low wave forcing surface currents were lower in the reef pass and could reverse near the bottom. The increase in flow speed through the ava channel at the study site is either caused by the increasing volume of water contributed by the reef flats on either side or a narrowing of the channel cross-section. Either way, the increase is notable for it's implications for placing a Eulerian ADCP at a fixed point in the channel, and using data from that one point to define flow for all of Faga'alu Bay.")

document.add_paragraph("Compared to Eulerian measurements, the Lagrangian measurements recorded higher mean flow speeds at all locations and during all forcings except for one: on the southern reef during wind forcing (Table 2). Lagrangian measurements are more influenced by processes at the surface, while Eulerian methods make a depth-averaged flow measurement. Surface flows can be faster due to the decreased flow speed near the bottom, or processes related to wind and gravity waves. One source of disagreement between the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods is the potential importance of Stokes drift (Stokes, 1847; Kenyon, 1969).

(2008) found that cruciform drifter speeds exceeded both Lagrangian dye and depth-averaged Eulerian current speeds (which included computed depth-averaged Stokes transport from wave gauge data) by 30-100% on average. A numerical simulation of a water column profile (Delft 3D) predicted drifter speeds at the surface should exceed the depth-averaged current speed plus Stokes drift by 30%, so Falter et al. (2008) attributed the discrepancy to higher Stokes transport near the surface, compared with the depth-averaged Stokes transport. Importantly, while the drifter speeds in Falter et al. (2008) were significantly higher, they did not differ from Eulerian measurements in current direction, and the ratio of Stokes transport to total transport decreased with increasing wave-driven currents. The results presented here show that the difference between Lagrangian and Eulerian measurements (not including Stokes drift) increased with wave-driven current speed (Table 2). The discrepancy between the ADCP and the drifter speeds may also be due to the heterogeneity of flow speeds within the 100m grid cell. The ADCPs were installed in relatively deeper parts of the reef where they could sample during all tide stages, but the flow speeds could be faster where it is forced up and over the coral heads and influence the drifter. Another potential error is surfing of the drifter, however, Falter et al. (2008) concluded the wave-induced deflection, normal to the current was low, so while this may explain some of the discrepancy it was not the dominant process.") 

document.add_paragraph("While the combination of Eulerian and Lagrangian methods is advantageous for interpreting spatial current patterns and speeds in relation to long-term forcing, in some cases, a single estimate of transport is needed, and the decision to use the Eulerian or Lagrangian estimates depends on the application. Falter et al. (2008) concluded that relying on solely Lagrangian estimates of water transport would have caused an overestimation of nutrient uptake on the reef by 30-100%, however, Falter et al. (2008) and others are interested in water properties that are evenly distributed through the water column. Other studies might be more interested in surface transport related to sediment plumes (Warrick, et al., 2007), plankton and larvae transport (Siegel et al., 2003), or alternatively, focused on currents near the bottom affecting shear stress and benthic sediment movement (Presto et al., 2006).")


## Take-away message
document.add_paragraph("The overrall pattern of mean flow speeds and flow directions showed a predominantly clockwise circulation through the bay under all forcing conditions, with higher flow speeds throughout the bay during wave forcing, compared to tidal and wind forcing. The shortest residence times were measured on the outer reef flat closest to where waves were breaking on the reef crest and were longest over the inner reef flat close to shore and deep in the northwest corner of the embayment. Given the proximity of the northern reef to the stream mouth and the occurrence of floods under typically low wave conditions in the wet season, or moderate easterly winds during the dry season, this suggests the northern reef and areas of the southern reef bordering the ava channel are under greatest threat of land-based sources of pollution. The spatial flow pattern and longer residence times result in greater exposure (= intensity x duration) of the corals in these areas to stress from terrestrial pollution, and likely causes the reduced coral health in these locations.")

document.add_paragraph("Coral reefs are physically and biologically heterogeneous environments, but ecologically important flow speeds and spatial patterns have been difficult to measure in relation to the long-term forcing conditions. Many water circulation studies significantly simplify the study site for modeling purposes or rely on only a few fixed instrument locations. The combination of spatially extensive Lagrangian drifters and temporally extensive Eulerian current meters presented here provides insight on the spatial patterns of flow within the context of variable circulation-forcing conditions. Nutrient uptake on coral reefs is considered to be limited primarily by the flow of water over the benthic surface (Bilger and Atkinson, 1992; Falter et al., 2004), and our results show that flow speeds can be highly variable over small scales on the reef. Nutrient uptake and other water quality parameters can be influenced by the depth and metabolic activity of the benthic surface contacted by a traveling water parcel, so the particular flow path and residence times of water over various benthic surfaces are important. Lowe and Falter (2015) argue that nutrient uptake mass-transfer models should be refined for smaller scale flows and tested in actual reef sites, but critical water circulation measurements to parameterize these models will require a combination of Eulerian and Lagrangian measurements similar to the methodology presented in this study.")


document.add_paragraph("Quantifying residence time and flow patterns in relation to endemember forcing conditions can be used to extrapolate the findings from a targeted study period to seasonal, annual, or longer time scale, by determining the proportion of days that are dominated by tidal, wind, or wave forcing. A similar approach could be used to extrapolate the effects on reef flat circulation from future climate scenarios with changing storm frequencies and characteristics. For instance, a predicted increase in the strength and frequency of Southern Ocean storms (Hemer et al., 2013) could be extended to predict changing sediment dynamics, temperature regimes and nutrient cycling at the study site (Lowe and Falter, 2015). The end-member forcing conditions could also be further refined to describe wave heights and wind speeds of varying magnitude, or combined with an empirical relationship accounting for varying tide stage, for finer-resolution predictive models of current speeds" )
#Or, flow speeds and directions could be determined by empirical relationships from the combination of forcing conditions instead of discrete categories. 

document.add_paragraph("This study investigated water circulation patterns driving sediment dynamics and resulting impacts on coral health at the study site, but water circulation is critical for understanding both the natural ecological processes and the impacts of anthropogenic impacts on all coral reefs. This study showed that flow speeds, flow directions, and water residence times were spatially heterogeneous in fringing-reef environments.")

#nutrients: Nutrient uptake by benthic organisms in coral reefs is limited only by the transfer of water , so variations in water flow at the small scales of coral organisms-coral canopies are very important. Our measurements show that water circulation is highly variable over the reef. Nutrient uptake models need to be refined and tested in live coral environments (Lowe 2015), but better methods for measuring water flow for those experiments are needed like our method presented here.

#Water quality changes depending on residence time (or water age) in the reef but also depends on its path of travel and which portions of the reef the water parcel was in contact with. These are only known by Lagrangian measurement methods. Organism metabolism can be highly variable over the reef but heat fluxes are near constant, and thus only changed by residence time and flow path.
